#### Rock-paper-scissors dynamic model for the evolution of sexual and costly reproduction

Summary

While sex can be advantageous for a lineage in the long term, we still lack an 

explanation for its maintenance with the twofold cost per generation. Here we model an 

infinite diploid population where two autosomal loci determine, respectively, the 

reproductive mode, sexual vs. asexual, and the mating system, polygynous (costly sex) 

vs. monogamous (assuming equal contribution of parents to offspring, i. e. non-costly 

sex). We show that alleles for costly sex can spread when non-costly sexual modes 

buffer the interaction between asexual and costly sexual strategies, even without 

twofold benefit of recombination with respect to asexuality. The three interacting 

strategies have intransitive fitness relationships leading to a rock-paper-scissors 

dynamics, so that alleles for costly sex cannot be eliminated by asexuals in most 

situations throughout the parameter space. Our results indicate that sexual lineages with 

variable mating systems can resist the invasion of asexuals and allow for long-term 

effects to accumulate.
